# Neural Network from Scratch

Simple 2-layer Neural Network, written from scratch using only numpy.

`model.py` contains the entire architecture of the simple neural network. I used a sigmoid activation function for simplicity.

`train.py` contains the code to train a `NeuralNetwork` object.

Please reach out for the link to `data` directory.
